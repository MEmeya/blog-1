But set aside all the hype about it being part of a dual-aperture system. What I really wanted to know about this change is how it might improve Samsung&rsquo;s low-light imaging. Having the widest aperture means being able to soak up the most light, so, in theory at least, the Galaxy S9 should be the best cameraphone for situations where light is at a premium. Except, well, there&rsquo;s Google&rsquo;s Pixel 2, which has taken over the mantle from the original Pixel as the best all-around camera on a phone. The Pixel achieves superlative results through clever image stacking and processing algorithms rather than pure hardware might. So it could still be the best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only solution to this uncertainty, of course, was to put the two cameras to the test. While in Geneva for the Motor Show, I went out for a late-night walk with the Galaxy S9 Plus and the Pixel 2 XL and took a bunch of side-by-side photos. It&rsquo;s worth acknowledging that the S9 Plus also has a second telephoto lens and a super slow-motion mode that the Pixel lacks &mdash; both situationally useful features, which would figure in a more comprehensive camera comparison, but here I&rsquo;m only interested in the single-camera still photo performance.</p>\r\n', '5aa96dcf0252e7.49497681.jpg', 3, 1),
